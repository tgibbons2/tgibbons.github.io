        For most of my life, I struggled with heavy depression. When I was young I didn't understand what was going on, I just that I knew I didn't feel good and I wanted my mom to pick me up from school. Throughout high school, I tried to maintain a decent social life to distract me from the problems at home but somehow I still felt alone, sad, and hopeless. At the start of my twenties, things took a dive for the worse. After health problems, multiple fires, losing everything, abusive relationships, and lawsuits, I decided this was not the life I was destined for and if I didn't do something about it soon, then I wasn't going to make it to my 30s. ​After a year of self-exploration, one amazing life coach and so many miracles I decided to make a podcast discussing my healing journey in hopes that it will help others heal too. I named this podcast after one of the seven spiritual laws of success. The law of pure potentiality is saying that you are pure potential! You have the power within you to become anything, and manifest anything you want in life.​ My goal is to share techniques that I learned (ones that aren't taught in therapy) and give my listeners a roadmap to a happier, healthier life.
